# Acknowledgements
Here is where we acknowledge resources used in this repostiory. We will do our best to keep this up-to-date but it may not be (especially in cases where the acknowledgement of a resource is not strictly required).

## Formatting
Starting with the next header, acknowledgements are listed. These are single-line acknowledgements that are hyperlinked with their source linked as well if possible (similarly to [`CREDITS.md`](https://github.com/cybemachine/dataselfieapp/blob/main/Wiki/other/credits.md).
Follow the [commit-prefixing](https://github.com/cybemachine/dataselfieapp/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-prefixing) guidelines to figure out where an acknowledgement should be placed.
Each Acknowledgement should be placed in a
- list.
